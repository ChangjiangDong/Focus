# Focus

Focus provides `focus-mode` that dims the text of surrounding sections, similar to [iA Writer's](https://ia.net/writer) Focus Mode.

## Installation

You can install Focus using elpa. It's available on [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

<kbd> M-x package-install focus </kbd>

The package has only been tried on Emacs 24.4 and 24.5, but should work on Emacs 24 or higher.

## Usage

Enable the mode with <kbd> M-x focus-mode </kbd>.

### Example

This is what it looks like:

Light Theme (leuven)                     |  Dark Theme (monokai)
